## About Me

I am (soon to be) a first-year PhD student of Mathematics at Queens' College, Cambridge, under the supervision of Dr Henry Bradford.

My research is in geometric group theory. I am interested in isoperimetric inequalities for groups.

I completed my MMath in 2025. For this I worked with generalisations of the Dehn function to groups of type FP<sub>2</sub>, which are not necessarily finitely presented.
