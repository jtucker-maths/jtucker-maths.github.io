## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student of Mathematics at Queens' College, Cambridge, under the supervision of Dr Henry Bradford.

My research is in geometric group theory. I am interested in Dehn functions, their generalisations to non-finitely presented groups, and the Boone-Higman conjecture.

I completed my MMath at Warwick in 2025. For this I worked with generalisations of the Dehn function to groups of type FP<sub>2</sub>, which are not necessarily finitely presented.

## Works

In the summer of 2024, I completed a short research project for Warwick's undergraduate research support scheme. The output can be seen <a href="https://urss.warwick.ac.uk/items/show/599">here</a>. The scheme also consisted of a public engagement aspect for which I wrote a short-lived <a href="https://tucker-urss2024.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. A slightly updated version of the original output can be found <a href="pdf/ursspaper.pdf">here</a>.

You can read my Master's thesis <a href="pdf/masters">here</a>.
