    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a first-year PhD student of Mathematics at Queens' College, Cambridge, under the supervision of Dr Henry Bradford.</p>
    <p></y>My research is in geometric group theory. I am interested in Dehn functions, their generalisations to non-finitely presented groups, and the Boone-Higman conjecture.</p>
    <p></p>I completed my MMath at Warwick in 2025. For this I worked with generalisations of the Dehn function to groups of type FP<sub>2</sub>, which are not necessarily finitely presented.</p>
    <h1>Works</h1>
    <h2>2025</h2>
    <p>You can read my Master's thesis <a href="pdf/masters.pdf">"Homological Dehn Functions"</a>.</p>
    <h2>2024</h2>
    <p>In the summer of 2024, I completed a short research project for Warwick's undergraduate research support scheme. The output can be seen <a href="https://urss.warwick.ac.uk/items/show/599">here</a>. The scheme also consisted of a public engagement aspect for which I wrote a short-lived <a href="https://tucker-urss2024.blogspot.com/">blog</a>. Here you can read an updated copy with nicer diagrams <a href="pdf/ursspaper.pdf">"An Upper Bound on the Dehn Function of $`Out(A_\Gamma)`$"</a>.</p>
    <p>I gave a <a href="https://echo360.org.uk/media/8ffbe461-8ab8-4029-ac14-acdd4c4d2cfe/public">talk</a> about this work at the WIMP (Warwick-Imperial) undergraduate maths conference in Autumn 2024.</p>
    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <h2>2025</h2>
    <p>In Michealmas term 2025, I will be supervising for the Part II Algebraic Topology course.</p>
    <h2>2024</h2>
    <p>In my final year at Warwick, I supervised several first-year students in their core modules for the whole academic year 2024/25.</p>
